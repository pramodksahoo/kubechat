# Security Policy

## Overview

KubeChat is committed to maintaining the highest security standards for our open source project. This document outlines our security policies, vulnerability disclosure procedures, and community security practices.

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Do NOT create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

### Preferred Reporting Methods

1. **Email (Recommended)**: [security@kubechat.dev](mailto:security@kubechat.dev)
   - GPG key available upon request
   - Response within 24 hours

2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: [Private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/pramodksahoo/kubechat/security/advisories/new)
   - Built-in secure communication
   - Coordinated disclosure support

3. **Emergency Contact**: For critical vulnerabilities requiring immediate attention
   - Email: [critical-security@kubechat.dev](mailto:critical-security@kubechat.dev)
   - Response within 4 hours during business hours

### What to Include in Your Report

To help us understand and resolve the issue quickly, please include:

**Required Information:**
- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and affected components
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: KubeChat version, Kubernetes version, deployment method
- **Discovery**: How you discovered the vulnerability

**Optional but Helpful:**
- **Proof of Concept**: Safe demonstration (no actual exploitation)
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation
- **Timeline**: Any disclosure timeline requirements you may have

### Example Security Report

```
Subject: [SECURITY] Authentication Bypass in API Endpoint

Description:
The /api/v1/queries endpoint allows unauthenticated access when a specific
header combination is used, bypassing JWT token validation.

Impact:
- Unauthorized users can process natural language queries
- Potential information disclosure about cluster state
- CVSS Score: 7.5 (High)

Reproduction Steps:
1. Send POST request to /api/v1/queries
2. Include headers: X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1, X-Real-IP: localhost
3. Omit Authorization header
4. Request is processed without authentication

Environment:
- KubeChat version: 1.0.0
- Deployment: Helm chart on EKS v1.28
- Network: Behind AWS Application Load Balancer

Suggested Fix:
Remove IP-based authentication bypass logic in middleware/auth.go line 45-52
```

## Security Response Process

### Our Commitment

- **Response Time**: We will acknowledge your report within 24 hours
- **Updates**: Regular updates on our progress toward a fix
- **Credit**: We will credit you for responsible disclosure (if desired)
- **Coordination**: We follow coordinated disclosure practices

### Response Timeline

1. **Acknowledgment** (Within 24 hours)
   - Confirm receipt of your report
   - Assign a tracking ID
   - Initial assessment of severity

2. **Investigation** (1-7 days)
   - Detailed analysis of the vulnerability
   - Impact assessment and CVSS scoring
   - Identification of affected versions

3. **Fix Development** (1-14 days depending on severity)
   - Develop and test the security fix
   - Prepare security advisory
   - Plan coordinated disclosure

4. **Release and Disclosure** (Coordinated with reporter)
   - Release patched version
   - Publish security advisory
   - Credit responsible disclosure

### Severity Classification

We use the CVSS v3.1 scoring system:

| Score | Severity | Response Time | Disclosure Timeline |
|-------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| 9.0-10.0 | Critical | 4 hours | 7 days |
| 7.0-8.9 | High | 24 hours | 14 days |
| 4.0-6.9 | Medium | 72 hours | 30 days |
| 0.1-3.9 | Low | 1 week | 60 days |

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Secure Development Guidelines

**Code Security:**
- Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak information
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Never hardcode secrets or credentials

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- Implement proper session management
- Use strong cryptographic algorithms (AES-256, RSA-2048+)
- Validate all JWT tokens properly
- Respect Kubernetes RBAC permissions
- Log all authentication attempts

**Data Protection:**
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper data retention policies
- Follow GDPR and privacy best practices
- Audit all data access operations
- Use secure communication channels
