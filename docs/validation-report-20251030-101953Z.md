## Section Results

### Checklist
Pass Rate: 9/11 (81.8%)

✓ PASS Overview clearly ties to PRD goals
Evidence: "This epic delivers the planning pipeline ... the Guarded Execution epic can consume." (docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md:12)

✓ PASS Scope explicitly lists in-scope and out-of-scope
Evidence: "**In Scope** - Natural-language parsing and intent classification for Kubernetes operations." (docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md:16)
Evidence: "**Out of Scope** - Command execution safeguards (covered by Epic E2)." (docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md:22)

✓ PASS Design lists all services/modules with responsibilities
Evidence: "| PromptController | `internal/api/prompts` | REST endpoints ..." (docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md:40)

⚠ PARTIAL Data models include entities, fields, and relationships
Evidence: "**Plan** (`plans` table) - `id` UUID ..." (docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md:49)
Gap: Relationships between entities (e.g., Plan ↔ audit_log, DiagnosticsSuggestion usage) are not described, leaving integration points ambiguous.

✓ PASS APIs/interfaces are specified with methods and schemas
Evidence: "`/api/v1/prompts` | POST | Submit NL prompt and receive plan ID |" (docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md:78)

✓ PASS NFRs: performance, security, reliability, observability addressed
Evidence: "Plan generation median < 5s; p95 < 10s with Ollama." (docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md:96)
Evidence: "Inputs sanitized to prevent prompt-injection leaking secrets." (docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md:100)
Evidence: "Provider adapter retries (max 2) with exponential backoff..." (docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md:105)
Evidence: "Metrics: `plan_generation_duration`, `plan_risk_level_total`, `plan_edit_count`." (docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md:109)

✓ PASS Dependencies/integrations enumerated with versions where known
Evidence: "PostgreSQL 15 for plan storage; migrations tracked in backend." (docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md:116)

✓ PASS Acceptance criteria are atomic and testable
Evidence: "1. System converts NL prompt into ordered plan steps with command..." (docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md:122)

✓ PASS Traceability maps AC → Spec → Components → Tests
Evidence: "| 1 | PRD §FR-1, UX Command Palette | `PromptController`, `PlanBuilder` |" (docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md:132)

⚠ PARTIAL Risks/assumptions/questions listed with mitigation/next steps
Evidence: "**Risk:** Provider latency spikes causing >10s plan builds → Mitigate with circuit breaker and fallback templates." (docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md:140)
Gap: "**Open Question:** Need confirmation on tenant-specific AI rate limits." lacks owner or next step; assumption has no mitigation follow-up (docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md:142-143).

✓ PASS Test strategy covers all ACs and critical paths
Evidence: "End-to-end tests: Playwright flows covering command prompt, plan editing, SSE updates..." (docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md:150)

## Failed Items
- None

## Partial Items
- Data models include entities, fields, and relationships — document the relationships between Plan, Audit Log, DiagnosticsSuggestion, and other entities to make integrations explicit.
- Risks/assumptions/questions listed with mitigation/next steps — add owners or next actions for the open question and clarify follow-up for key assumptions.

## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: Expand the data model section with explicit relationships (Plan ↔ Audit Log, DiagnosticsSuggestion usage, PlanStream events) and define next steps/owners for open questions to satisfy governance expectations.
2. Should Improve: Include how DiagnosticsSuggestion entities flow into execution or UI components, and outline the cadence for updating cluster metadata to address risk mitigation commitments.
3. Consider: Add version/service-level notes for optional AI connectors to aid deployment planning.
