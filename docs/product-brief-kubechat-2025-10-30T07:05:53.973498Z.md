**Date:** 2025-10-30T07:05:53.973498Z
**Author:** pramoda
**Status:** Draft for PM Review

---

## Executive Summary

- Kubechat transforms manual Kubernetes incident response into a guarded, explainable NL→kubectl workflow built on Kubechat.
- Primary users (SRE/Platform teams) recover 30–50% faster by reviewing AI-generated plans with mandatory dry-runs and approvals.
- Multi-cluster visibility, streaming diagnostics, and tamper-proof audit logs consolidate fragmented tooling into one console.
- Enterprise guardrails (RBAC, policy packs, offline AI, exportable evidence) enable adoption in regulated, air-gapped environments.
- OSS distribution plus an enterprise tier unlock community growth, design-partner validation, and future monetization.

---

## Problem Statement

- A 4–6 person SRE/Platform team plus 5–10 on-call developers still rely on manual `kubectl` and ad-hoc scripts for day-two Kubernetes operations.
- Live cluster changes lack preview/approval checkpoints; wrong context/namespace actions surface roughly 1–2 times per quarter despite informal peer checks.
- Weekly CLI mistakes, inconsistent scripts, and manual cross-cluster triage consume 20–60 minutes per incident with another 10–20 minutes spent pivoting across tools.
- Roughly 60–80% of direct cluster activity lacks a concise, human-readable audit trail, making “who ran what, where, when, why” investigations slow.
- Process gaps cost ~4–6 engineer-hours of rework each month and drive 1–3 avoidable customer-impacting incidents per year.

---

## Proposed Solution

- Alert-to-action flow: natural-language prompt generates a scoped diagnostic plan (logs, metrics, events) plus recommended kubectl actions with blast-radius analysis.
- Guardrailed execution: every mutating command shows exact CLI, dry-run output, policy checks, optional approvals, and rollback capture before running.
- Real-time operations console: chat and Kubechat visuals stay synchronized; execution streams logs/metrics with AI annotations and follow-up suggestions.
- Safety net: context locks, RBAC pre-checks, two-person approvals, policy enforcement (delete/scale/time windows), and tamper-proof audit history.
- Differentiators: explainable NL→kubectl, correlated telemetry in one thread, multi-cluster fan-out with explicit context switching, AI provider abstraction, enterprise-grade compliance foundations.

---

## Target Users

### Primary User Segment

- Roles: Site Reliability, Platform, and DevOps Engineers plus senior developer power users responsible for Kubernetes operations.
- Environment: 5–50 clusters (50–1,000 nodes, 5k–30k pods) across cloud/on-prem (EKS/GKE/AKS/OpenShift) with GitOps deploys and Prometheus/Grafana/Loki/ELK observability in regulated settings (SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI/HIPAA/GDPR).
- Pain points: fear of wrong cluster/namespace, manual label/dry-run checks, inconsistent scripts, fragmented cross-cluster triage, and difficult audit reconstruction.
- Needs: explainable previews, consistent guardrails, correlated telemetry, and rich auditability without juggling terminals, dashboards, and scripts.

### Secondary User Segment

- On-call Application Engineers – require guided, low-risk remediation, plain-language summaries, and quick service health plus change context.
- Ops/Platform Managers – need fleet rollups, policy/RBAC adherence views, SLO and error-budget trends, and audit coverage metrics.
- Security/Compliance Teams – expect tamper-proof logs, exportable evidence, data residency clarity, and traceable who/what/where/when/how records.
- Support/Customer Success – depend on read-only incident timelines, blast-radius indicators, and real-time rollout/rollback status for communications.

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements

- Operate across 5–50 Kubernetes clusters with multi-cluster observability and guarded operations.
- Support offline/air-gapped environments with local AI inference and zero mandatory external dependencies.
- Leverage Kubechat UI primitives for resource visualization and extend them with chat-driven orchestration.
- Provide real-time streaming for logs/exec and rollout status with backpressure handling for large clusters.

### Technology Preferences

- Backend: Go 1.23 using client-go, REST/WS/SSE endpoints, SQLite for dev, PostgreSQL for production.
- Frontend: TypeScript/React with Vite, virtualized data grids, and shared component/state libraries.
- AI layer: provider abstraction defaulting to Ollama with optional GPT/Claude/Gemini connectors via secure adapters.
- Packaging: single binary bundling frontend assets; Helm chart with CRDs (AIProvider, AuditPolicy) for cluster installs.
- CI/CD: automated tests, security scans, signed multi-arch images, release automation scripts.

### Architecture Considerations

- Fork Kubechat while preserving upstream compatibility and merge cadence.
- Enforce RBAC, TLS, and secret redaction across services; audit logs tamper-evident and stored in-cluster.
- Disable outbound network access by default; allow opt-in providers through explicit policy.
- Support Kubernetes N-3 versions without using alpha APIs; rely on server-side pagination/filtering for scale.
- Adopt PR-only development with Codex-generated changes reviewed by humans to maintain quality.

---

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints

- OSS licensing must remain Apache-2.0 compatible; avoid GPL-only dependencies.
- Architecture tied to Kubechat foundation, single binary + Helm packaging, and zero mandatory cloud services.
- Security posture requires RBAC enforcement, TLS everywhere, secret redaction, tamper-evident audit logs, and data residency within the user cluster.
- AI stack must default to offline Ollama with configurable GPT/Claude/Gemini connectors and prompt/PII redaction.
- Support Kubernetes N-3 versions with server-side filtering/pagination for scale; no alpha API reliance.
- Delivery capacity constrained to a small team plus Codex PR workflow with frozen MVP scope.

### Key Assumptions

- Kubechat APIs and structure remain compatible or mergeable with manageable effort.
- Operators can run Ollama locally or in-cluster with acceptable latency and resource cost.
- Design partners will provide representative clusters (read-only initially, scoped write for validation).
- Existing kubeconfig/RBAC and network access are already in place for participating teams.
- SQLite is sufficient for development; Postgres will be provisioned for production deployments.
- Teams will adopt read-only mode first, then graduate to guarded write workflows.

## Risks and Open Questions

### Key Risks

- AI accuracy/safety: NL→kubectl plans could be wrong or overconfident despite previews.
- Policy misconfiguration: overly strict or lax guardrails create friction or unsafe bypass paths.
- Performance/scale: large fleets (10k+ pods) may strain UI/API without virtualization and caching.
- Upstream drift: rapid Kubechat changes introduce merge debt and regressions.
- Security/supply chain: generated code, new dependencies, or CI gaps may introduce vulnerabilities; plugin surface expands attack area.
- Throughput: limited reviewer bandwidth and flaky tests could slow Codex-driven delivery.
- Privacy/compliance: misconfigured egress could leak prompts to external LLMs.

### Open Questions

- LLM evaluation approach: offline accuracy/safety benchmarks, redaction patterns, latency expectations.
- Policy model choice: OPA/Rego versus built-in rules, default packs, and two-person approval mechanics.
- Rollback semantics: determining which state snapshots (replicas, images, manifests) to capture and verify post-change.
- Storage & retention: sizing audit/log storage, pruning/backups, and export formats at scale.
- Multi-cluster orchestration: modeling waves, health gates, pause/rollback criteria.
- Telemetry strategy: opt-in metrics scope, privacy controls, or fully disabled mode.
- Integrations prioritization: sequencing Slack/PagerDuty/Jira and webhook versus native apps.
- Packaging & pricing: structuring enterprise/support tiers, policy/analytics add-ons, plugin governance.

### Areas Needing Further Research

- Benchmark NL→kubectl accuracy and safety across target models (Ollama, GPT, Claude, Gemini).
- Prototype policy enforcement using OPA/Rego and compare against embedded rule engine.
- Design rollback metadata schema capturing deployment deltas and verification steps.
- Model audit log growth and retention policies for 5–50 cluster footprints.
- Experiment with phased rollout orchestration and health gating across multiple clusters.
- Define telemetry opt-in controls that satisfy privacy/regulatory requirements.
- Evaluate integration surface between chat console and incident tooling (Slack, PagerDuty, Jira).
