## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.6 (Kubernetes Cluster Integration):
- Backend APIs are fully implemented with comprehensive command execution workflows
- WebSocket endpoints available for real-time updates on command approval and execution
- RBAC integration provides permission validation that frontend must display
- Audit trail system captures all user actions requiring frontend integration
- Safety classification system (safe/warning/dangerous) needs UI representation

- **React:** 18.3+ with modern hooks and concurrent features
- **Next.js:** 14+ for server-side rendering and routing
- **TypeScript:** 5.6+ for type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS:** 3.4+ for utility-first styling
- **Headless UI:** 2.1+ for accessible, unstyled UI components

**Development Tools:**
- **Vitest:** 2.0+ for frontend testing framework
- **Testing Library:** 16+ for React component testing
- **Playwright:** 1.47+ for end-to-end browser testing

### Component Architecture
**File Structure Requirements:**
```
apps/web/src/components/
├── ui/              # Basic UI components
│   ├── Button/, Card/, Input/, Modal/
│   └── index.ts
├── forms/          # Form-specific components
├── layout/         # Layout components (Header, Sidebar, Main)
├── dashboard/      # Dashboard-specific components
├── chat/          # Chat interface components
└── security/      # Security and compliance components
```

**Component Organization Standards:**
- PascalCase component names (QueryInput, ClusterHealthDashboard)
- Export interfaces and components from index.ts files
- Each component includes .tsx, .test.tsx, and index.ts

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#frontend-file-structure]

### State Management
**Zustand Store Requirements:**
```typescript
// Required stores for this story
- authStore: User authentication and profile data
- uiStore: Navigation state, modal management, theme
- dashboardStore: Cluster health, metrics, recent activities
- chatStore: Chat history, command preview, approval states
- complianceStore: Audit data, compliance status
```

**State Management Patterns:**
- Never mutate state directly - use proper Zustand patterns
- Actions return promises for async operations
- Error states managed within each store

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#state-management-rules]

### API Integration
**Service Layer Requirements:**
- Never make direct HTTP calls - use service layer pattern
- API services: authService, dashboardService, chatService, auditService
- Consistent error handling through service wrapper
- Authentication headers managed by service layer

**Available Backend Endpoints (from Story 1.6):**
```
POST /api/v1/commands/execute          # Command execution
GET  /api/v1/commands/executions       # List executions
POST /api/v1/commands/approve          # Approval workflow
GET  /api/v1/commands/health           # Service health
GET  /api/v1/commands/stats            # Execution statistics
WebSocket /api/v1/commands/ws          # Real-time updates
```

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#api-communication-rules, apps/api/internal/handlers/command/routes.go]

### Styling and Design System
**Tailwind Configuration:**
- Responsive breakpoints: sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl
- Custom color palette for enterprise DevOps tools
- Consistent spacing and typography scales
- Dark/light theme support with CSS custom properties

**Accessibility Requirements:**
- WCAG AA compliance throughout
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Screen reader support with proper ARIA labels
- High contrast mode compatibility
- Focus management for modals and forms

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-technologies]

### Real-time Integration
**WebSocket Requirements:**
- Connect to `/api/v1/commands/ws` for real-time updates
- Handle command execution status changes
- Display approval workflow notifications
- Update cluster health status in real-time
- Graceful fallback to polling if WebSocket fails

**Performance Considerations:**
- Component memoization with React.memo
- Proper useEffect dependency arrays
- Virtual scrolling for large lists (audit logs, command history)
- Image optimization with Next.js
- Bundle splitting for code organization

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#performance-standards]

### Security Integration
**Authentication Patterns:**
- JWT tokens for session management
- Protected routes with authentication guards
- Role-based component rendering
- Secure session management

**RBAC Display Requirements:**
- Show user permissions and roles
- Disable functionality based on user permissions
- Display security context for command operations
- Active session management interface

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#authentication-authorization]

### Testing Requirements
**Component Testing:**
- Vitest with Testing Library for component tests
- Jest mocks for API services
- Accessibility testing with jest-axe
- Responsive design testing

**E2E Testing:**
- Playwright for browser automation
- Multi-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- User workflow testing (login, chat, command execution)
- Screenshot and video capture on failures

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]

### Container-First Development
**Development Workflow:**
- NO local `pnpm run dev` - container-only development
- Build with `make dev-rebuild-web`
- Deploy with `helm upgrade kubechat-dev`
- Access via NodePort URLs for testing
- Hot-reload capability through container volumes

**Production Requirements:**
- Multi-stage Dockerfile for optimal production images
- Non-root user in containers
- Proper resource limits and health checks
- Next.js production optimization
