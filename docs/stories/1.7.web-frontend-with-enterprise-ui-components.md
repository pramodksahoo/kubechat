### Component Architecture
**File Structure Requirements:**
```
apps/web/src/components/
├── ui/              # Basic UI components
│   ├── Button/, Card/, Input/, Modal/
│   └── index.ts
├── forms/          # Form-specific components
├── layout/         # Layout components (Header, Sidebar, Main)
├── dashboard/      # Dashboard-specific components
├── chat/          # Chat interface components
└── security/      # Security and compliance components
```

**Component Organization Standards:**
- PascalCase component names (QueryInput, ClusterHealthDashboard)
- Export interfaces and components from index.ts files
- Each component includes .tsx, .test.tsx, and index.ts

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#frontend-file-structure]

### State Management
**Zustand Store Requirements:**
```typescript
// Required stores for this story
- authStore: User authentication and profile data
- uiStore: Navigation state, modal management, theme
- dashboardStore: Cluster health, metrics, recent activities
- chatStore: Chat history, command preview, approval states
- complianceStore: Audit data, compliance status
```

**State Management Patterns:**
- Never mutate state directly - use proper Zustand patterns
- Actions return promises for async operations
- Error states managed within each store

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#state-management-rules]

### API Integration
**Service Layer Requirements:**
- Never make direct HTTP calls - use service layer pattern
- API services: authService, dashboardService, chatService, auditService
- Consistent error handling through service wrapper
- Authentication headers managed by service layer

**Available Backend Endpoints (from Story 1.6):**
```
POST /api/v1/commands/execute          # Command execution
GET  /api/v1/commands/executions       # List executions
POST /api/v1/commands/approve          # Approval workflow
GET  /api/v1/commands/health           # Service health
GET  /api/v1/commands/stats            # Execution statistics
WebSocket /api/v1/commands/ws          # Real-time updates
```

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#api-communication-rules, apps/api/internal/handlers/command/routes.go]

### Styling and Design System
**Tailwind Configuration:**
- Responsive breakpoints: sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl

- Consistent spacing and typography scales
- Dark/light theme support with CSS custom properties

**Accessibility Requirements:**
- WCAG AA compliance throughout
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Screen reader support with proper ARIA labels
- High contrast mode compatibility
- Focus management for modals and forms

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-technologies]

### Real-time Integration
**WebSocket Requirements:**
- Connect to `/api/v1/commands/ws` for real-time updates
- Handle command execution status changes
- Display approval workflow notifications
- Update cluster health status in real-time
- Graceful fallback to polling if WebSocket fails

**Performance Considerations:**
- Component memoization with React.memo
- Proper useEffect dependency arrays
- Virtual scrolling for large lists (audit logs, command history)
- Image optimization with Next.js
- Bundle splitting for code organization

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#performance-standards]

### Security Integration
**Authentication Patterns:**
- JWT tokens for session management
- Protected routes with authentication guards
- Role-based component rendering
- Secure session management

**RBAC Display Requirements:**
- Show user permissions and roles
- Disable functionality based on user permissions
- Display security context for command operations
- Active session management interface

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#authentication-authorization]

### Testing Requirements
**Component Testing:**
- Vitest with Testing Library for component tests
- Jest mocks for API services
- Accessibility testing with jest-axe
- Responsive design testing

**E2E Testing:**
- Playwright for browser automation
- Multi-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- User workflow testing (login, chat, command execution)
- Screenshot and video capture on failures

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]

### Container-First Development
**Development Workflow:**
- NO local `pnpm run dev` - container-only development
- Build with `make dev-rebuild-web`
- Deploy with `helm upgrade kubechat-dev`
- Access via NodePort URLs for testing
- Hot-reload capability through container volumes

**Production Requirements:**
- Multi-stage Dockerfile for optimal production images
- Non-root user in containers

**Remaining Minor Areas for Optimization:**
- Security: Token storage recommendation still applies for maximum security
- Performance: Dashboard progressive loading remains a future enhancement opportunity

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed during this review as the code quality and test architecture have been significantly improved by the development team. The testing foundation is now excellent with proper service layer testing.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✅ Maintains TypeScript best practices and component structure
- **Project Structure**: ✅ Continues to adhere to defined architecture standards
- **Testing Strategy**: ✅ **SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED** - Now exceeds minimum coverage requirements with 22 comprehensive test files
- **All ACs Met**: ✅ All 16 acceptance criteria remain fully implemented and validated

### Updated Test Architecture Review

**Current Test Coverage: Significantly Improved**

**Test Files Now Include:**
- **Service Tests (NEW)**: errorService.test.tsx, statusService.test.tsx, chatService.test.tsx
- **UI Component Tests**: Card.test.tsx, Input.test.tsx, Modal.test.tsx, StatusIndicator.test.tsx
- **Layout Tests**: MainLayout.test.tsx, Header.test.tsx, UserProfile.test.tsx
- **Feature Tests**: Security, Compliance, Chat, Dashboard component tests
- **Error Handling Tests**: ErrorBoundary.test.tsx

**Coverage Quality Assessment:**
- ✅ **errorService**: 93.66% function coverage with comprehensive error handling scenarios
- ✅ **statusService**: 94.54% function coverage with real-time monitoring validation
- ✅ **chatService**: Improved coverage with proper API mocking
- ✅ **UI Components**: Full coverage for Card (100%), Input (100%), and other core components
- ✅ Tests demonstrate excellent practices with proper mocking, accessibility testing, and edge case coverage

### Updated Security Review

**Authentication & Authorization: IMPROVED ⚠️ → ✅**
- ✅ JWT token management thoroughly tested in service layer
- ✅ Role-based rendering validation through component tests
- ✅ Error handling prevents information leakage (validated through error service tests)
- ⚠️ Token storage recommendation remains for maximum security (minor consideration)

### Updated Performance Considerations

**Testing Performance: EXCELLENT ✅**
- ✅ Service layer performance validated through comprehensive testing
- ✅ Error handling performance tested with retry mechanisms
- ✅ Real-time status updates tested with proper WebSocket mocking
- ⚠️ Dashboard progressive loading remains a future enhancement

### Updated Gate Status

**Gate Decision: PASS** ✅ → Updated from previous CONCERNS
**Quality Score: 95/100** ⬆️ (Previously: 80/100)
**Risk Assessment: Low** (Previously: Medium)
