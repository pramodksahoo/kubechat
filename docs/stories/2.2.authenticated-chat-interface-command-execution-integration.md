### Component Architecture Integration

Based on established patterns [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#component-organization]:

**Chat Interface Components:**
```typescript
// Chat Interface Component Structure
src/components/chat/
├── ChatInterface.tsx              # Main chat container with authentication
├── ChatSession.tsx               # Individual chat session management
├── MessageList.tsx               # Chat message display with history
├── MessageInput.tsx              # Command input with NLP integration
├── CommandPreview.tsx            # Command preview before execution

└── CollaborationPanel.tsx        # Team collaboration features
```

### State Management Architecture

**Chat Store Integration:**
Building on authentication store from Story 2.1 [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#state-store-patterns]:

```typescript
// Chat State Management Integration
interface ChatState {
  // Authentication Integration
  authStore: AuthStore; // From Story 2.1

  // Chat Sessions
  activeSessions: ChatSession[];
  currentSession: ChatSession | null;
  sessionHistory: ChatSession[];

  // Message Management
  messages: ChatMessage[];
  messageHistory: ChatMessage[];

  // Command Execution
  pendingCommands: CommandExecution[];
  activeExecutions: CommandExecution[];
  executionHistory: CommandExecution[];

  // WebSocket Management
  websocketConnections: Map<string, WebSocket>;
  connectionStatus: 'connected' | 'disconnected' | 'reconnecting';

  // Actions with Authentication
  createSession: () => Promise<ChatSession>;
  sendMessage: (sessionId: string, message: string) => Promise<void>;
  executeCommand: (command: CommandRequest) => Promise<CommandExecution>;
  loadHistory: (filters: HistoryFilters) => Promise<void>;
}
```

```

### Security Integration Requirements

**Authentication Security:**
Building on Story 2.1 security foundation [Source: docs/architecture/security.md]:

1. **JWT Token Integration:** All chat APIs require valid JWT tokens from authentication system
2. **Permission Validation:** User permissions checked for each command execution request
3. **Session Security:** Chat sessions tied to authenticated user identity
4. **Input Sanitization:** All natural language queries sanitized for security
5. **Command Authorization:** Dangerous commands require additional authorization workflow
6. **Audit Trail Integration:** All chat activities logged for compliance and security

### WebSocket Security Architecture

**Authenticated WebSocket Implementation:**
```typescript
// Secure WebSocket Connection with Authentication
class AuthenticatedWebSocketService {
  private authStore = useAuthStore.getState();
  private chatStore = useChatStore.getState();

  async connectToChat(sessionId: string): Promise<WebSocket> {
    const token = await this.authStore.getValidToken();

    const socket = new WebSocket(`${config.websocket.baseUrl}/ws/chat/${sessionId}`, {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`
      }
    });

    socket.onmessage = (event) => {
      const update: ChatUpdate = JSON.parse(event.data);
      this.chatStore.handleChatUpdate(update);
    };

    socket.onerror = (error) => {
      // Handle authentication errors and token refresh
      this.handleWebSocketError(error);
    };

    return socket;
  }
}
```

### Performance Requirements

**Chat Interface Performance:**
- Message loading must complete in <1 second for 100+ message history
- Command execution status updates must have <500ms latency
- WebSocket reconnection must complete in <3 seconds
- Session switching must be instantaneous with proper caching
- Search through message history must return results in <2 seconds

### Integration with Navigation

**Main Navigation Enhancement:**
Based on established navigation patterns, update main navigation:

```typescript
// Updated Navigation with Chat Integration
const mainNavigation = {
  items: [
    { path: "/dashboard", title: "Dashboard", icon: "dashboard" },
    { path: "/chat", title: "Chat", icon: "chat", badge: "active-sessions" }, // 🎯 NEW
    { path: "/history", title: "History", icon: "history" }, // 🎯 NEW
    // ... existing items
  ]
};
```

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Standards:**
Based on established framework [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#testing-framework]:

**Test File Locations:**
- **Unit Tests:** `apps/web/tests/components/chat/`
- **Integration Tests:** `apps/web/tests/integration/chat/`
- **E2E Tests:** `apps/web/tests/e2e/chat/`
