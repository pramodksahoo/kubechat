### Database Schema Requirements from Epic
[Source: docs/epics/epic-1-foundation-community-launch.md]

**Required Database Schema:**
```sql
-- Users and Authentication
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,

    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    session_token VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    session_id UUID REFERENCES user_sessions(id),
    query_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    generated_command TEXT NOT NULL,

);
```

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Critical Implementation Rules:**
- **Container-First Development:** All development through containers, no local database connections
- **Error Handling:** All database operations must use standard error handler patterns
- **Audit Trail:** Every database modification must generate audit log entry
- **Repository Pattern:** Use repository interface pattern for data access
- **Type Safety:** Import types from shared packages, never define locally

**Database Repository Pattern:**
```go
type UserRepository interface {
    Create(ctx context.Context, user *models.User) error
    GetByID(ctx context.Context, id uuid.UUID) (*models.User, error)
    Update(ctx context.Context, user *models.User) error
}
```

**Security Standards:**
- Input validation for all database queries
- SQL injection prevention using parameterized queries
- Secure random token generation for sessions
- bcrypt password hashing with appropriate cost factor

### Development Environment Configuration
[Source: docs/architecture/deployment.md]

**Database Management Commands Required:**
```bash
make dev-db-connect    # Connect to development database
make dev-db-migrate    # Run database migrations
make dev-db-seed       # Seed development data
make dev-db-reset      # Reset database to clean state
```

**Container-First Database Access:**
- No direct database connections from host machine
- All database operations through Kubernetes port-forwarding
- Development database accessible via NodePort or kubectl port-forward

### File Locations for Implementation
- **Migration Scripts:** `/kubechat/infrastructure/scripts/database/migrations/`
- **Migration Management:** `/kubechat/infrastructure/scripts/database/migrate.sh`
- **Database Models:** `/kubechat/apps/api/internal/models/`
- **Repository Layer:** `/kubechat/apps/api/internal/repositories/`
- **Database Utilities:** `/kubechat/apps/api/pkg/utils/`
- **Helm Configuration:** `/kubechat/infrastructure/helm/kubechat/values-dev.yaml`

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Standards:**
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Database Testing Strategy:**
- **Unit Tests:** Repository layer testing with mock databases
- **Integration Tests:** Full database integration with test containers

- **Testify 1.9+** for assertions and test suites
- **Test containers** for database integration testing
- **Database fixtures** for consistent test data

### Security and Compliance Requirements

**Immutable Audit Logs Critical Features:**
- Once written, audit entries cannot be modified
- SHA-256 checksum of each record for integrity validation
- Checksum chain linking to previous entry for tamper detection
- All user actions must be logged for SOX, HIPAA, SOC 2 compliance

**Encryption Requirements:**
- Kubernetes configurations encrypted at rest using AES-256
- User passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost factor 12+)
- Session tokens cryptographically secure random generation
- Database connections use TLS encryption

**Access Control:**
- Role-based access control integrated with user roles
- Session expiration with configurable timeout
- IP address validation for session security
- Audit trail for all authentication and authorization events

### Project Structure Alignment
The implementation must align with the existing project structure from Story 1.1:
- Build on existing PostgreSQL 16+ configuration in Helm chart
- Extend existing Makefile database management commands
- Integrate with existing container-first development workflow
- Use existing Rancher Desktop environment setup
- Follow established coding standards and error handling patterns

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.2-database-schema-infrastructure-setup.yml
Risk profile: High-risk due to security implementation and insufficient test coverage
NFR assessment: Meets performance, security, and reliability requirements

### Recommended Status

✗ Changes Required - Critical test coverage gap must be addressed

**BLOCKING ISSUES:**
1. **No database model tests** - Models with security functions need unit tests
2. **No repository integration tests** - Data layer needs comprehensive test coverage
3. **No audit integrity tests** - Cryptographic functions need security validation

The implementation quality is excellent, but the absence of testing for critical security features creates unacceptable risk for production deployment.
