### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Critical Container-First Development Rules:**
- **Rule:** Never run `pnpm run dev` or `go run` locally - use containers only
- **Enforcement:** All development must happen through `make dev-deploy` and container access
- **File Organization:** Follow exact monorepo structure with proper naming conventions
- **Import Patterns:** Use proper TypeScript and Go import organization

**Security Requirements:**
- Use specific versions in Dockerfiles, never 'latest'
- Non-root user in all containers  
- Vulnerability scanning integration
- Container security best practices

### Rancher Desktop Validation Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/deployment.md]

**Environment Verification Commands:**
```bash
# Check Kubernetes cluster status
kubectl cluster-info

# Verify nodes are ready  
kubectl get nodes

# Check available storage classes
kubectl get storageclass
```

**Expected Output Validation:**
- Kubernetes control plane at https://127.0.0.1:6443
- Node status: Ready with control-plane,master roles
- Storage class: local-path with rancher.io/local-path provisioner
