## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4, the following external API integration foundation has been established:
- OpenAI API client with comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Circuit breaker pattern for external API resilience
- Cost tracking and usage monitoring for API calls
- Kubernetes secret-based credential management
- Rate limiting with burst support and Redis coordination
- Multi-level encryption service for sensitive data
- Health monitoring and alerting for external APIs

### Technical Architecture Context

**Backend Technologies** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-technologies]:
- **Go:** 1.23+ for backend services and APIs
- **Gin:** 1.10+ HTTP web framework for REST APIs
- **PostgreSQL:** 16+ for audit trails and query history
- **Redis:** 7.4+ for caching and session management

**Container-First Development** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#container-first-development-rules]:
- All development through container builds: `make dev-rebuild-api`
- Kubernetes deployment: `make dev-deploy`
- No local Go processes allowed (`go run` prohibited)
- All services must run in containerized environment

### File Structure and Locations

**Service Implementation** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#backend-file-structure]:
- `apps/api/internal/services/nlp/` - NLP service implementation for command generation
- `apps/api/internal/services/safety/` - Safety classification service
- `apps/api/internal/handlers/nlp/` - HTTP handlers for NLP endpoints
- `apps/api/internal/handlers/query/` - Query processing endpoints

**Package Structure**:
- `apps/api/pkg/safety/` - Public safety validation utilities
- `apps/api/pkg/nlp/` - Public NLP client packages
- `apps/api/internal/models/` - Query and response data models

**Repository Layer**:
- `apps/api/internal/repositories/query.go` - Query history repository
- `apps/api/internal/repositories/safety.go` - Safety decision repository

### Safety Classification Framework

**Safety Level Classification**:
- **Safe:** Read-only operations (get, describe, logs)
- **Warning:** Potentially impactful operations (scale, patch)
- **Dangerous:** High-risk operations (delete, create, apply)

**Command Validation Rules**:
```go
// Example safety patterns
var SafeCommandPatterns = []string{
    "kubectl get.*",
    "kubectl describe.*",
    "kubectl logs.*",
    "kubectl top.*",
}

var DangerousCommandPatterns = []string{
    "kubectl delete.*",
    "kubectl apply.*",
    "kubectl create.*",
    ".*--force.*",
    ".*--cascade.*",
}
```

**Context-Aware Safety Adjustments**:
- Production environment: Higher safety thresholds
- Development environment: More permissive rules
- User role (admin vs. developer): Different access levels
- Namespace context: Restricted operations in critical namespaces

### NLP Service Architecture

**Multi-Provider Abstraction** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#ai-integration]:
```go
type NLPService interface {
    GenerateCommand(ctx context.Context, req NLPRequest) (*NLPResult, error)
    ValidateCommand(ctx context.Context, command string) (*SafetyResult, error)
    GetProviders() []string
    SetProvider(provider string) error
}

type NLPRequest struct {
    Query       string            `json:"query"`
    Context     map[string]string `json:"context"`
    Namespace   string            `json:"namespace,omitempty"`
    UserRole    string            `json:"user_role"`
    Environment string            `json:"environment"`
}

type NLPResult struct {
    Command      string        `json:"command"`
    Explanation  string        `json:"explanation"`
    SafetyLevel  string        `json:"safety_level"`
    Confidence   float64       `json:"confidence"`
    Suggestions  []string      `json:"suggestions,omitempty"`
    Warnings     []string      `json:"warnings,omitempty"`
}
```

### Prompt Engineering Strategy

**Base Prompt Template**:
```text
You are a Kubernetes command generator. Convert natural language queries into kubectl commands.

Context:
- Namespace: {{.Namespace}}
- User Role: {{.UserRole}}
- Environment: {{.Environment}}

Query: {{.Query}}

Return only valid kubectl commands. Consider safety and best practices.
```

**Safety-Enhanced Prompts**:
- Include safety warnings in responses
- Provide alternative safer commands when possible
- Explain potential impacts of dangerous operations
- Suggest confirmation steps for high-risk operations

### Audit Integration Requirements

**Required Audit Fields** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#audit-trail-rules]:
```go
type QueryAuditEntry struct {
    ID              uuid.UUID `json:"id"`
    UserID          uuid.UUID `json:"user_id"`
    SessionID       uuid.UUID `json:"session_id"`
    NaturalLanguage string    `json:"natural_language"`
    GeneratedCommand string   `json:"generated_command"`
    SafetyLevel     string    `json:"safety_level"`
    SafetyReasons   []string  `json:"safety_reasons"`
    Context         map[string]string `json:"context"`
    ProcessingTime  time.Duration `json:"processing_time"`
    Success         bool      `json:"success"`
    Error           string    `json:"error,omitempty"`
    Timestamp       time.Time `json:"timestamp"`
}
```

### Performance and Caching Strategy

**Redis Caching Strategy**:
```go
// Cache key patterns
queryCache:{{hash(query+context)}} -> NLPResult
safetyCache:{{hash(command)}} -> SafetyResult
userContext:{{userID}} -> UserContext

// TTL strategies
- Query results: 1 hour (frequently changing cluster state)
- Safety classifications: 24 hours (more stable)
- User contexts: Session duration
```

**Performance Targets**:
- Query processing: <3 seconds including AI call
- Cached queries: <100ms
- Safety validation: <50ms
- Audit logging: <10ms (async)

### External API Integration

**OpenAI Integration** [Building on Story 1.4]:
- Use existing OpenAI client from `apps/api/internal/services/external/openai_client.go`
- Leverage existing rate limiting and circuit breaker
- Utilize cost tracking for query processing
- Implement NLP-specific error handling and fallbacks

**Multi-Provider Preparation**:
```go
type ProviderConfig struct {
    Name       string            `json:"name"`
    Type       string            `json:"type"` // openai, ollama, etc.
    Config     map[string]string `json:"config"`
    Enabled    bool              `json:"enabled"`
    Priority   int               `json:"priority"`
}
```

### Error Handling and Fallback

**Error Classification** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#error-handling-rules]:
```go
type NLPError struct {
    Code     string `json:"code"`
    Message  string `json:"message"`
    Provider string `json:"provider"`
    Retryable bool  `json:"retryable"`
}

// Error types
const (
    ErrCodeInvalidQuery    = "INVALID_QUERY"
    ErrCodeUnsafeCommand   = "UNSAFE_COMMAND"
    ErrCodeProviderError   = "PROVIDER_ERROR"
    ErrCodeContextInvalid  = "CONTEXT_INVALID"
    ErrCodeRateLimit      = "RATE_LIMIT"
)
```

**Fallback Strategies**:
1. Cached similar queries
2. Template-based responses for common patterns
3. Mock responses in development
4. Graceful degradation with limited functionality
