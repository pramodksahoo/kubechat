### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Backend Technologies:**
- **Go:** 1.23+ for backend services and APIs
- **Gin:** 1.10+ HTTP web framework for REST APIs
- **client-go:** v0.30+ for Kubernetes integration and cluster management
- **PostgreSQL:** 16+ primary relational database (already configured)
- **Redis:** 7.4+ for caching, sessions, and real-time features

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- **JWT tokens** for session management
- **RBAC integration** with Kubernetes
- **Secure headers** and CORS configuration
- **Input validation** and sanitization

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Critical Implementation Rules:**
- **Container-First Development:** All development through containers, no local Go processes
- **Error Handling:** All API routes must use standard error handler patterns with ServiceError
- **Audit Trail:** Every user action must generate audit log entry
- **Repository Pattern:** Use repository interface pattern for data access (already implemented)
- **Type Safety:** Import types from shared packages, never define locally

**Service Architecture Pattern:**
```go
type QueryService interface {
    ProcessQuery(ctx context.Context, req ProcessQueryRequest) (*QueryResult, error)
    ExecuteCommand(ctx context.Context, req ExecuteCommandRequest) (*ExecutionResult, error)
}

type queryService struct {
    nlpService    NLPService
    k8sClient     K8sClient
    auditService  AuditService
    logger        Logger
}
```

**Authentication Patterns:**
- JWT tokens for session management
- RBAC integration with Kubernetes
- Secure headers and CORS configuration
- Input validation and sanitization

### Database Integration Requirements
[Source: Previous Story 1.2]

- **UserSessions:** ID, UserID, SessionToken, ExpiresAt, IPAddress, UserAgent with secure token generation
- **AuditLogs:** Immutable audit trail with cryptographic integrity and checksum chaining
- **ClusterConfigs:** Encrypted kubeconfig storage with AES-256-GCM encryption

**Database Connection Management:**
- Connection pooling configuration already implemented
- Database utilities for health checking available
- Repository pattern interfaces already defined
- Migration system with up/down capabilities available

### Service-to-Service Communication Requirements

**Required Service Interfaces:**
- **AuthService:** User authentication and session management
- **KubernetesService:** Cluster connection and kubectl operations
- **NLPService:** Natural language processing and command generation
- **AuditService:** Audit trail logging and compliance

### Container-First Development Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md + Epic 1 - Container-First Development Workflow]

**Prohibited Commands:**
- `go run ./cmd/server` - No local backend processes
- Direct local development outside containers

**Required Development Workflow:**
- `make dev-build` - Build containers with latest code
- `make dev-deploy` - Deploy to Kubernetes cluster
- `make dev-logs` - View application logs
- `make dev-shell-api` - Access backend container

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Epic-Level Task Completion Workflow**
**For EVERY task, developers MUST follow this 5-step completion workflow:**
1. **Code Implementation** - Complete the task requirements
2. **Container Build** - `make dev-rebuild-api` to build with latest changes
3. **Deploy to Cluster** - `make dev-deploy` or `helm upgrade kubechat-dev` 
4. **End-to-End Testing** - Verify functionality works in deployed environment
5. **Mark Complete** - Only after successful build, deploy, and E2E verification

**No exceptions** - this ensures container-first compliance, production parity, and prevents untested code from reaching completion.

### External API Integration Requirements
[Source: Epic 1 Critical Requirements]

**Required External API Setup:**
- **OpenAI API:** Account creation, API key generation, rate limit handling
- Secure API key storage in Kubernetes secrets with encryption

- Secure session management with JWT tokens
- bcrypt password hashing (cost factor 14 already implemented)
- Rate limiting per user and IP address
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

**RBAC Integration:**
- Kubernetes permission validation before command execution
- User role-based access control
- Service account management
- Cluster context validation

### Service Architecture Patterns

**Microservice Structure:**
Each service should follow the established patterns:
1. Service interface definition
2. Service implementation with dependency injection
3. Error handling using ServiceError patterns
4. Audit logging integration
5. Health check endpoints
6. Graceful shutdown procedures

**File Locations for Implementation:**

- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable rate limiting per user and IP address with proper thresholds
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with expiration, refresh, and cleanup procedures

### Performance Considerations

**STATUS: WELL OPTIMIZED - NO PERFORMANCE CONCERNS**

Strong performance considerations implemented throughout:

- **Database**: Connection pooling with pgx, health monitoring, failover mechanisms
- **External APIs**: Circuit breakers, retry logic, request/response caching for NLP service
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connection management with heartbeat monitoring
- **Resource Management**: Proper timeout configurations, graceful shutdown procedures
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive health checks and metrics collection capabilities

### Files Modified During Review

**No files modified** - Code quality is excellent and did not require QA-level modifications.

### Gate Status

**Gate: CONCERNS** → `docs/qa/gates/1.3-core-backend-services-architecture.yml`

**Primary Concerns:**
1. **Test Coverage Measurement**: Despite comprehensive test files, Go coverage reports 0.0% across all packages, contradicting the claimed >80% coverage
2. **Test Execution Dependencies**: Repository tests require Docker/PostgreSQL containers which may limit CI execution
3. **Container Workflow Evidence**: While container build commands exist, complete verification of Epic-Level Container-First workflow completion needs clearer documentation

**Risk Assessment**: Medium - Implementation quality is excellent, but test coverage verification is blocked
