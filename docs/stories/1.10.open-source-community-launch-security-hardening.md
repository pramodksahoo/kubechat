## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 1.9:** Production-ready Helm deployment with comprehensive monitoring, security scanning, and multi-environment support is now complete. This provides the foundation for documenting secure deployment procedures and demo environments.

### Project Structure Requirements
**Source:** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#complete-monorepo-structure]

**Documentation File Locations:**
- Root directory files: README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- GitHub templates: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory
- Architecture docs: `docs/architecture/` (existing structure)
- API documentation: `docs/api/` (to be created)
- Demo configurations: `infrastructure/helm/kubechat/demo/` (to be created)

### Technology Stack for Documentation
**Source:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#required-technology-versions]

**Key Technologies to Document:**
- Frontend: Node.js 20+, TypeScript 5.6+, React 18.3+, Next.js 14+, Tailwind CSS 3.4+
- Backend: Go 1.23+, Gin 1.10+, client-go v0.30+
- Database: PostgreSQL 16+, Redis 7.4+
- Container/Orchestration: Docker, Kubernetes 1.28+, Helm 3.15+, Rancher Desktop
- Development: PNPM 8+, Air 1.49+, Vitest 2.0+, Playwright 1.47+

**Container-First Development Principles:**
**Source:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#container-first-development-rules]
- Prohibited: `pnpm run dev`, `go run ./cmd/server`, local development servers
- Required: `make dev-build`, `make dev-deploy`, `make dev-logs` workflow
- Rationale: Production parity, consistent environment, air-gapped deployment support

### Coding Standards for Community
**Source:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

**Critical Rules to Document in CONTRIBUTING.md:**
1. **Type Safety:** Always define types in `packages/shared` and import from there
2. **API Communication:** Never make direct HTTP calls - use service layer
3. **Environment Configuration:** Access only through config objects, never process.env directly
4. **Error Handling:** All API routes must use standard error handler
5. **State Management:** Never mutate state directly - use proper Zustand patterns
6. **Container-First Development:** Never run local processes - use containers only
7. **Kubernetes Integration:** All kubectl operations through K8s client service with RBAC
8. **Audit Trail:** Every user action must generate audit log entry

### Security Standards for Community
**Source:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#security-standards]

**Security Requirements for Contributors:**
- Input validation patterns with sanitization examples
- Authentication patterns with JWT and RBAC integration
- Container security with non-root users and specific version tags
- Database security with prepared statements and connection pooling
- Secret management with Kubernetes secrets and encryption

### Deployment Architecture for Documentation
**Source:** [Source: architecture/deployment.md#development-environment-configuration]

**Demo Deployment Components:**
- Rancher Desktop setup with Kubernetes 1.28+
- Helm 3.15+ installation and configuration
- Complete Makefile commands for development workflow
- Port forwarding configuration (3001->web, 8080->api, 5432->postgres, 6379->redis)
- Environment validation commands and expected outputs

### Testing Framework for Contributors
**Source:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]

**Testing Requirements to Document:**
- Frontend: Vitest 2.0+ for unit tests, Testing Library 16+ for React, Playwright 1.47+ for E2E
- Backend: Go testing package, Testify 1.9+ for assertions, httptest for handlers
- Container-based test execution with integration testing requirements
- Test coverage targets and quality gates (>80% coverage requirement)

### File Organization Standards
**Source:** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#directory-purposes]

**Project Structure to Document:**
- `/apps/` - Application services (web React, api Go)
- `/packages/` - Shared code (shared types, ui components, config)
- `/infrastructure/` - DevOps (helm charts, docker, scripts, k8s manifests)
- `/docs/` - Documentation (architecture, stories, troubleshooting)
- `/tests/` - Cross-service testing (unit, integration, e2e, performance)

### Open Source License Considerations
**Source:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#enforcement]

**License Selection Criteria:**
- Enterprise-friendly for adoption (MIT or Apache 2.0 preferred)
- Patent protection for AI/ML components if applicable
- Contribution License Agreement (CLA) requirements
- Security disclaimer and liability limitations
- Compatible with Go and React ecosystem licenses

## Testing
