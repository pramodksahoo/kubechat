- Development values configured with NodePort services (web: 30001, api: 30080)
- Container images using 'dev' tags with IfNotPresent pull policy
- Basic resource limits configured for development environment
- Database initialization ConfigMap already implemented

**Current Service Ports:**
```bash
localhost:30001  -> kubechat-web       # Frontend application
localhost:30080  -> kubechat-api       # Backend API
localhost:30050  -> pgadmin            # Database admin UI
localhost:30081  -> redis-commander    # Redis admin UI
```
