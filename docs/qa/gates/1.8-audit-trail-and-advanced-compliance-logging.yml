# Architecture Assessment

code_quality_assessment:
  strengths:
    - 'Comprehensive type definitions with proper TypeScript interfaces'
    - 'Well-structured database schema with proper constraints and indexes'
    - 'Cryptographic integrity implementation with SHA-256 checksums'
    - 'Proper separation of concerns between models, services, and UI components'
    - 'Container-first development workflow compliance'
    - 'Comprehensive error handling and validation'

  areas_for_improvement:
    - 'Complex SQL functions need better inline documentation'
    - 'Some frontend service methods could benefit from JSDoc comments'
    - 'Integration test coverage could be expanded'

# Risk Assessment

risk_profile:
  high_risk_areas:
    - 'Cryptographic checksum functions critical for integrity - any bugs could compromise audit trail'
    - 'Database performance under high audit volume - materialized views help but need monitoring'
    - 'Legal hold functionality affects regulatory compliance - must be thoroughly tested'

  mitigation_strategies:
    - 'Comprehensive unit tests for cryptographic functions implemented'
    - 'Performance monitoring functions and materialized views in place'
    - 'Database constraints and validation rules prevent data corruption'

# Test Coverage Analysis

test_coverage:
  backend_go:
    models: 'Good coverage with comprehensive audit model tests'
    services: 'Basic service tests present, could expand integration tests'
    repositories: 'Repository tests implemented with database integration'

  frontend_typescript:
    components: 'Basic component tests present, coverage could be improved'
    services: 'Audit service has good error handling but needs more test coverage'

  overall_assessment: 'Test coverage meets >80% requirement but has gaps in integration scenarios'
