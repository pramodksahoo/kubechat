nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent security implementation: JWT with proper claims, bcrypt cost 14, security headers, audit logging with SHA-256 integrity, parameterized queries"
  performance:
    status: PASS  
    notes: "Good performance considerations: connection pooling, caching strategies, rate limiting, circuit breakers, proper timeouts"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Strong reliability: comprehensive error handling, health checks, failover mechanisms, graceful shutdown, retry logic"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent maintainability: clean interfaces, dependency injection, proper separation of concerns, comprehensive documentation"

    note: "Initial review - test coverage measurement showing 0.0% despite comprehensive test files"
  - at: "2025-09-11T20:45:00Z"
    gate: PASS
    note: "QA fixes successfully applied - coverage measurement resolved (21.6%), make-based testing implemented, Kubernetes integration working"

strengths:
  - "Comprehensive service architecture with proper interface segregation"
  - "Excellent security implementation with multiple layers of protection"  
  - "Strong audit trail with cryptographic integrity verification"
  - "Proper error handling and recovery patterns throughout"
  - "Clean separation between layers (handlers, services, repositories)"
  - "Comprehensive feature set covering all acceptance criteria"
  - "Successful Epic-Level Container-First Development Workflow compliance"
  - "Working test coverage measurement and CI/CD compatible testing"

technical_debt:
  - "Test coverage can be expanded beyond current 21.6%"
  - "Some repetitive handler patterns could be extracted to middleware"
  - "Mock interfaces could be generated rather than hand-written"
