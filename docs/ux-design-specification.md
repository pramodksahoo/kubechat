**Project Level:** 4 – Brownfield, multi-cluster enterprise platform

## 1. Core Experience Summary

### Primary Promise
Turn a natural-language prompt into a safe, reviewed, audited Kubernetes action in seconds. Every experience decision must reinforce confidence, clarity, and speed.

### Critical Flow
`prompt → structured plan → preview/dry-run → approvals (if needed) → execution with live feedback → instant rollback → audit trail + incident note.`

- Zero ambiguity between what was requested and what will run
- Every stage exposes scope (cluster/namespace), risk, and rollback options
- Audit visibility is visible throughout the journey—not an afterthought

### Platform Targets
- Responsive web application (primary)
- Single-binary local mode serving embedded UI for laptops/on-prem installs
- Future PWA/desktop wrapper for read-only approvals and incident timeline review

### Operational Context
| Context | Implications for UX |
| --- | --- |
| On-call, low light | Default dark theme, high-contrast variants, minimal motion |
| Low bandwidth / VPN | SSE fallback to polling, lightweight diff/stream updates, explicit sync state |
| Air-gapped security | Local-first assets, no third-party calls by default, explicit egress toggles |
| Fatigue under pressure | <2s plan render budget, clear errors, keyboard-first controls, calming microcopy |
| Accessibility | Full keyboard navigation, focus traps, ARIA labels, color-blind-safe status chips |

---

## 2. Primary Personas & Goals

| Persona | Key Goals | Pain Points Today |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Site Reliability Engineer | Diagnose and remediate incidents with guardrails | Manual kubectl, context mistakes, no traceable audit |
| Platform Engineer | Maintain policy compliance, enforce safe operations | Ad-hoc scripts, inconsistent approvals, lack of rollback context |
| On-call App Engineer | Guided remediation with clear guardrails | CLI unfamiliarity, fear of destructive commands |
| Compliance / Security | Rapid evidence gathering | Fragmented logs, slow “who/what/when/why” answers |

---

## 3. Experience Pillars & Desired Emotion

| Pillar | Experience Intent | UX Levers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Clarity** | Understand scope, risk, and outcome at a glance | Structured plan cards, color-coded risk badges, inline diffs |
| **Control** | Feel empowered to approve, edit, or abort at any point | Edit-in-place parameters, contextual approvals, rollback shortcut |
| **Velocity** | Execute the full flow faster than raw kubectl | Command palette shortcuts, Shift+Enter for dry-run, pre-filled templates |
| **Auditability** | Trust the record without extra work | Live timeline, auto-generated incident notes, export buttons |

Desired emotional response: **Calm confidence.** Users should feel supported, informed, and in command, even during high-pressure incidents.

---

## 4. Primary User Journeys

### Journey A – Guided Remediation (SRE)
1. Global prompt bar (⌘/Ctrl-K) accepts natural-language request
2. Plan card renders with commands, scope, risk, and suggested diagnostics in <2 seconds
3. Preview/dry-run panel runs in-line; warnings highlight high-risk operations
4. Approval sub-flow shows policy requirements and request/response timeline
5. Execution stream attaches to incident timeline with live status chips
6. Rollback CTA stays persistent until operation confirmed stable
7. Auto-generated incident note summary appears for editing/sharing

### Journey B – Multi-Cluster Investigation (Platform Engineer)
1. Cluster context banner defaults to saved “Primary prod” view
2. Aggregated pods/events table (virtualized) filtered via keyboard shortcuts
3. Inline actions for describe/log tail populate timeline with cluster badges
4. Telemetry sidebar correlates recent deploys, config changes, and alert spikes
5. User pins insight cards to share with on-call teammates

### Journey C – Compliance Evidence (Audit Lead)
1. Audit tab presents filterable timeline with search by user, action type, cluster
2. Export modal offers signed CSV/JSON with metadata and hash verification
3. Report links reference incident timeline entries and approval history

## 5. Information Architecture & Navigation
```
Top App Bar
├── Global Command Palette (⌘/Ctrl-K)
├── Cluster/Namespace Context Badge
├── Status Indicators (AI Provider, Policy Pack, Connectivity)
└── User Menu (Profile, Theme, Settings)

Primary Layout
├── Left Rail: Timeline (prompts, actions, diagnostics, approvals)
├── Main Canvas: Adaptive content (Plan cards, tables, logs, forms)
└── Right Rail: Insights (telemetry, approvals, policies, related alerts)
```

Responsive breakpoints: 1440px (desktop), 1200px (small desktop), 960px (tablet), 640px (mobile read-only mode).

---

## 6. Visual & Interaction Direction

### 6.1 Color Themes
- **Primary:** Midnight Slate (dark base) with Electric Indigo accents
- **Elevated States:** Success – Emerald Glow; Warning – Amber Pulse; Danger – Crimson Beacon
- **Neutral Palette:** Graphite, Silver Mist, Soft Slate

Produce HTML color swatch (see `ux-color-themes.html`).

### 6.2 Typography & Iconography
- Headings: `Inter` Bold for clarity
- Body: `Inter` Regular 16px
- Code/CLI: `JetBrains Mono` 14px
- Icons: Remix Icon set customized for risk levels (outline, filled states)

### 6.3 Layout Patterns
- Plan cards: 12-column grid, responsive collapse to stacked sections
- Tables: Virtualized rows with sticky cluster badge column, inline actions row
- Timeline: Vertical, timestamp left-aligned, collapsible detail blocks
- Modals: 720px max-width, focus-trapped, progressive disclosure for advanced settings

### 6.4 Interaction Fluency
- Command palette surfaces recent prompts, saved templates, quick actions
- Dry-run preview uses split-screen diff with JSON/YAML toggle
- Approvals appear as layered modal with context; approvals broadcast to timeline
- Logs/Exec panels allow pause/resume, search, download, with persistent controls

## 7. Accessibility & Safety Considerations

| Requirement | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Keyboard navigation | Tab order follows left rail → main → right rail; shortcuts documented in help overlay |
| Screen reader support | ARIA labels for plan cards, risk badges, timeline entries; live regions for status updates |
| Color contrast | Danger/Warning/Info badges >4.5:1; dark/light theme toggles |
| Confirmation for high-risk actions | Double-confirmation with policy summary and RBAC check results |
| Secret redaction | Logs and plan previews redact tokens via regex before display |

---

## 8. Component Inventory

- Prompt Input & Plan Card
- Risk Badge (status + tooltip details)
- Approval Request Panel
- Execution Stream Tile
- Timeline Entry (prompt, action, diagnostic, approval, note)
- Cluster Context Selector
- Multi-cluster Table (pods/events/deploys)
- Log Viewer
- Command Palette Modal
- Incident Notes Editor
- Settings/Onboarding Wizard (kubeconfig upload, provider checks)

Each component has associated states documented within the specification sections below.

---

## 9. Success Metrics & UX Validation Plan

| Metric | Target |
| --- | --- |
| Time from prompt to approved plan | <60 seconds p90 |
| Plan comprehension (usability test) | ≥90% of participants correctly describe scope/risk |
| Dry-run override frequency | <5% of runs without justification |
| Audit export satisfaction | ≥4/5 rating in compliance stakeholder review |
| Accessibility audit | WCAG 2.1 AA pass with zero critical issues |

Validation activities: Remote usability sessions with SREs, dark-room testing, keyboard-only walkthrough, compliance export drill.

---

## 10. Next Steps & Handoff

1. Generate interactive design direction HTML mockups (`ux-design-directions.html`) for stakeholder review.
2. Create color theme visualization (`ux-color-themes.html`).
3. Iterate with PM/SRE leads on plan card hierarchy and timeline readability.
4. Prepare assets for engineering handoff (component specs, accessibility notes).

_This specification guides the detailed mockups and prototyping phases. All subsequent UX deliverables should reference these decisions._
