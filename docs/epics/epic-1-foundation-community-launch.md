    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'user',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- User Sessions
CREATE TABLE user_sessions (

## Notes ‚ö†Ô∏è UPDATED WITH CHECKLIST FINDINGS

### Implementation Strategy
This epic establishes the foundational platform that all future epics build upon. **Critical focus on security, database integrity, and rollback capabilities** based on PO checklist analysis. The goal is to prove the core value proposition works and can be deployed reliably **with enterprise-grade security and compliance**.

### Security-First Approach (NEW)
Every story includes security considerations and threat modeling. **No story is complete without security review and penetration testing**. The audit trail integrity and RBAC integration are foundational security features that all future epics depend on.

### Database-First Architecture (NEW)  
The database schema and migration strategy are foundational to all other features. **No story can proceed without proper database design and rollback procedures**. The audit trail integrity using cryptographic checksums is a unique competitive advantage.

### Community Strategy
Open source launch preparation is critical for early adoption and community feedback. **Security hardening and responsible disclosure processes** are essential for community trust. The documentation and contribution guidelines should encourage community participation while maintaining security standards.
