# Epic 2: Ollama Integration & Enterprise Frontend Completion

## Epic Overview

**Epic ID:** EPIC-2
**Epic Name:** Ollama Integration & Enterprise Frontend Completion
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Story Points:** 48
**Duration:** 6-8 Sprints

## Epic Goal

Complete the enterprise-grade frontend interfaces for existing backend APIs while adding Ollama as a local AI provider option, enabling both online (OpenAI) and offline (Ollama) AI capabilities with comprehensive admin and user management interfaces.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Analysis:**
- ✅ Rich backend APIs already implemented (multi-provider AI, user management, audit trail, command workflow)
- ✅ Basic chat interface UI exists but is non-functional
- ❌ **CRITICAL GAP:** Chat interface not connected to backend APIs - queries don't process, commands don't execute
- ❌ **Missing:** Frontend-backend integration for core chat functionality
- ❌ **Missing:** AI provider selection and model management UI
- ❌ **Missing:** Admin interfaces for user, audit, and resource management

**Enhancement Strategy:**
- **PRIORITY 1:** Fix core chat interface to connect with existing backend APIs
- **PRIORITY 2:** Add Ollama service and AI provider selection UI once chat works
- **PRIORITY 3:** Build comprehensive admin interfaces for existing `/users`, `/audit`, `/kubernetes` APIs
- Implement command approval workflow UI for existing approval system
- Create enterprise dashboards for monitoring and management
- Complete frontend-backend integration for all existing capabilities

**Success Criteria:**
- **CRITICAL:** Core chat interface functional - queries process and commands execute with results
- Ollama integrated as local AI provider alongside existing OpenAI
- All backend APIs have corresponding frontend interfaces
- Complete admin user management and RBAC interfaces implemented
- Enterprise audit trail and compliance dashboards functional
- Command approval workflow UI operational
- Kubernetes resource management interface complete

### Container-First Development Workflow ⚠️ CRITICAL FOR ALL TASKS
**This workflow requirement applies to EVERY task in EVERY story:**

**⚠️ SCRUM MASTER NOTE: The following workflow section MUST be added to every story in this epic:**

**Task Completion Workflow (Required for ALL tasks):**
1. **Code Implementation** - Complete the task requirements
2. **Container Build** - `make dev-rebuild-api` or `make dev-rebuild-web`
3. **Deploy to Cluster** - `make dev-deploy` or `helm upgrade kubechat-dev`
4. **End-to-End Testing** - Verify functionality works in deployed environment
5. **Mark Complete** - Only after successful build, deploy, and E2E verification

**CRITICAL RULE: No task is considered complete without successful container build, cluster deployment, and end-to-end verification.**

This ensures:
- Container-first development compliance
- No untested code reaches completion
- Continuous integration of changes
- Early detection of deployment issues
- Production parity maintenance
