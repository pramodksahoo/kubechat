## Epic Description

### **üö® CRITICAL SECURITY SITUATION - VERIFIED ANALYSIS**
**Current State Analysis (Backend Verified ‚úÖ):**
- ‚úÖ **Rich backend APIs implemented** (multi-provider AI, user management, audit trail, command workflow)
  - ‚úÖ Chat APIs: `/api/v1/chat/sessions` with full CRUD operations
  - ‚úÖ NLP APIs: `/api/v1/nlp/process`, `/api/v1/nlp/validate`, `/api/v1/nlp/classify`
  - ‚úÖ Command APIs: `/api/v1/commands/execute`, `/api/v1/commands/approvals/pending`
  - ‚úÖ WebSocket: `/api/v1/ws` for real-time communication
  - ‚úÖ Authentication APIs: `/api/v1/auth/login`, `/api/v1/auth/register`, `/api/v1/auth/refresh`

**Current State Analysis (Frontend Verified ‚ö†Ô∏è):**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partial frontend authentication** - Login/Register components exist but integration incomplete

### Container-First Development Workflow ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL FOR ALL TASKS
**This workflow requirement applies to EVERY task in EVERY story:**

**‚ö†Ô∏è SCRUM MASTER NOTE: The following workflow section MUST be added to every story in this epic:**

**Task Completion Workflow (Required for ALL tasks):**
1. **Code Implementation** - Complete the task requirements with security controls
2. **Container Build and Deploy**: `make dev-upgrade-web` and `make dev-upgrade-api` with security validations
3. **Deploy to Cluster** - `make dev-deploy` or `helm upgrade kubechat-dev`
4. **End-to-End Testing** - Verify functionality works in deployed environment
5. **Mark Complete** - Only after successful build, deploy, and E2E verification

**CRITICAL RULE: No task is considered complete without successful container build, cluster deployment, and end-to-end verification.**

This ensures:
- Container-first development compliance
- No untested code reaches completion
- Continuous integration of changes
- Early detection of deployment issues
- Production parity maintenance
- Security validation in deployed environment
