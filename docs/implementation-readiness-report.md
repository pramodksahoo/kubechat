# Implementation Readiness Report – Kubechat

**Generated:** 2025-10-30T09:45:30.423776Z
**Assessor:** Architect (Winston)

## Overview
- Project Level: 4 (brownfield, enterprise scale)
- Documents reviewed: PRD, Architecture, Epics, UX specification, Technical decisions log
- Objective: Confirm planning/solutioning artifacts align before Phase 4 implementation.

## Findings Summary
- **PRD ↔ Architecture**: Functional pillars (NL→plan→approve→execute, audit/export, multi-cluster, packaging) fully mapped to architecture components and decisions.
- **Architecture ↔ Epics**: Each epic references the packages/components defined in architecture; optional Redis/object storage and CI security tasks now represented (E6.5, E6.6).
- **UX Alignment**: Dark theme, keyboard-first interactions, telemetry rails, and accessibility requirements reflected in epics (E3/E4) and architecture implementation patterns.
- **NFR Coverage**: Performance (<3s load, SSE fallback), compliance logging, security posture, and accessibility are specified across documents.

## Gap & Risk Analysis
| Severity | Item | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Medium | Secrets rotation & multi-cluster credential guidance absent | Added Story E5.5 to capture runbook deliverable. |
| Low | Optional Redis/object storage ownership unclear | Story E6.5 documents enablement and assigns infra ownership. |
| Low | Cosign/OTEL credential provisioning not explicit | Story E6.6 ensures CI/CD secrets prepared before signing/tracing. |

No contradictions or blocking issues detected.

## Recommendations Before Coding
1. Groom Story E5.5 with security/compliance stakeholders to finalize rotation SOP.
2. Coordinate infra ownership for optional Redis/Object storage enablement (E6.5).
3. Prepare cosign keys and OTEL endpoint credentials for the pipeline (E6.6).

## Readiness Conclusion
- **Status:** Ready to enter Phase 4 (Implementation).
- **Conditions:** Track the medium/low items above during sprint planning; no blockers remain.

## Next Step
Proceed to Scrum Master workflow `*sprint-planning` to create the implementation plan.
